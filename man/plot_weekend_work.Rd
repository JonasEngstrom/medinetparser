plot_weekend_work(
  tidy_schedule,
  shift_types = c("PjourD", "MjourD", "Bjour", "LÃ¥ngF", "Pjour", "Mjour"),
  shift_days = c("Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"),

    "50-75\% lediga helger", "75-100\% lediga helger")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tidy_schedule}{A schedule loaded by \code{load_tidy_schedule()}.}

\item{shift_types}{The shift types in Medinet to count as weekend work.
Certain shift types, such as vacation, should not be included in this
vector to yield accurate results.}

\item{shift_days}{The days to count as weekend. Defaults to Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday, as weekend on-call shifts would start on Friday in the
schedule. This might vary by department and might need to be adjusted.}

\item{quartile_labels}{Labels for quartiles in the graph. As it defaults to
Swedish, this parameter is included to facilitate use in other languages.
Axis labels and titles can be changed using standard \code{ggplot2} syntax.}
}
\value{
A ggplot.
